<p><em>PS: <b>two additional notes</b>: </em></p>
<p><em>1.) The registration cost of the Leatherman&#39;s Loop incorporates the <a href=""https://parks.westchestergov.com/ward-pound-ridge-reservation/ward-pound-ridge-fees"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">park&#39;s entry fee</a> into the registration cost -- so the park does not have to collect the $10 fee from each entrant on race morning. Long ago we figured out it was more efficient for us to pay the park that fee directly rather than have hundreds of cars line up at the entrance fumbling for cash at the entrance gate to the Rez on race morning. </em></p>
<p><em>2.) <a href=""https://leathermansloop.org/frequently-asked-questions/#dogs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><strong>Dogs</strong> are not permitted to run in the Loop</a>. In 2020 the USATF began a new policy prohibiting dogs from running in races they sanction and insure. The Loop is a USATF sanctioned and insured race. <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">Leashed dogs</span> are welcome at the park anytime. </em></p>",https://runsignup.com/Race/NY/CrossRiver/LeathermansLoop,https://leathermansloop.org,,leathermansloop,,"Reservation Road",,"Cross River",NY,10518,US,America/New_York,https://d368g9lw5ileu7.cloudfront.net/races/race5968-scaled-logo-0.bysUXM.png,T,"2025-06-03 19:25:32",EuMWyAqP...,10

With every stride, every mile, and every finish line crossed, we are contributing to the vital work of the Center for Safety &amp; Change and their mission to support, shelter and provide services to victims and survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, human trafficking and other crimes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year’s theme <strong>CHASE THE CHANGE </strong>embodies the spirit of this event. It reminds us that change starts with each of us—through our actions, our unity, and our commitment to making the world a safer and more equitable place. Together, we’re not just chasing the finish line; we’re chasing a future where everyone can thrive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Women&#39;s Distance Festival was created by the Road Runners Club of America as a protest to a lack of competitive races for women both in the Olympics and nationally. It was believed as recently as the 1980 Olympics, that women could not compete at distances of greater than 1500 meters, which is less than 1 mile!  In America, in July of 1980, the first Women&#39;s Distance Festivals were run opposite the Mens&#39; Marathon at the Moscow Olympics. The Rockland Road Runners picked up the Women&#39;s Distance Festival in 1988, and it has now grown to be the largest Women and Girls 5K in the tristate area!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Join us to experience the <b>ENERGY, POWER, and DETERMINATION</b> of this incredible event as we come together for the 38th Annual <strong>Women&#39;s Distance Festival 5K Run/Walk on July 13th at 8:00am.  </strong>There will also be a virtual event for those who cannot participate in person.  The virtual event will run from Sunday, July 13 through Sunday, July 20.

The Volksläufe, meaning “The People’s Race” in German, embraces the spirit of family, friendship, and fitness, inviting participants to a fun and meaningful celebration. Hosted by the Frankenmuth Jaycees, this year’s event is set to be our biggest yet, with every mile and every cheer contributing to charitable causes close to our community’s heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our 50th ANNUAL race will feature the traditional 5K, 10K, and half-marathon distances, guiding runners through Frankenmuth’s picturesque Bavarian streets, scenic countryside, and the peaceful Cass River. But that’s not all! For our youngest runners and those new to racing, we offer the 2K Fun Run, a shorter route filled with the same high spirits and cheers as the longer races. The Volksläufe has something for everyone, from serious athletes to families looking for holiday fun!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As always, the Frankenmuth Jaycees’ mission goes beyond the race. Every dollar raised will fund our spectacular July 3rd fireworks display and support various charitable initiatives throughout the year. After crossing the finish line, stick around to enjoy post-race festivities with food, live music, and family-friendly activities!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Volksläufe is about people — racers, families, friends, and our incredible volunteers. Together, we’ll make the 50th edition unforgettable!

<h3>Raven Rocks Run - 10k Trail Run</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Raven Rocks Run is a challenging 10k trail run at Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River, NY.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The TENTH running of the race will be in November.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Race will be in-person <strong>Sunday, November 9, 2025</strong> starting at 9am. <em>(Final race date approval pending county permit.)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The race will start in the Meadow near the fallen oak tree and its massive remains. The course passes by the spot where the Leatherman’s Loop begins. Instead of heading towards the river as the Loop does, the <b>Raven Rocks Run 10k</b> course climbs and climbs up to the two highest points in the park (Raven Rocks Overlook and the Fire Tower Summit) before heading back for a (mostly) downhill and (relatively) flat finish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The course passes by the site of the former Blue Trail fire tower which is the highest point in the park. We are working towards getting back the tower to its former spot in the park. See <a href=""https://ravenrocksrun.org/course-map"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Course Map</a> page for course details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More information about the race and tower project is on the <a href=""https://ravenrocksrun.org/about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">About</a> page and the <a href=""https://ravenrocksrun.org/faq/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">FAQ page</a> of our ravenrocksrun.org website.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to November when we will run this event for the TENTH time!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Important: Our Raven Rocks Run race plans are contingent on permit approval from the Westchester County Department of Parks, Recreation, and Conservation. This approval is not guaranteed but has been obtained for the prior nine races. As in all prior years we open registration with the understanding that the race will take place. We will update runners if the permit is not approved for the current year. </p>

His older son claims to have started wearing bow ties in the late 80s, forging his own fashion identity. The elder Dempsey, admiring the look, decided to give them a try himself. Taking it a step further, Dr. Dempsey even sought out lessons to learn how to tie them properly. He and his son spent hours practicing and mastering the skill. From there, the trademark look was born. Dr. Dempsey frequently sported bow ties in his daily professional life, and they became his calling card. After his passing, his sons inherited his tie collection, and one continues to wear the bow ties today. In this way, the bow tie has become a unique and touching way to remember a great and unique man</span></p>

A family’s whole life changes just like that and it does not go back to normal. Bills and stress are at an all-time high and help from others is critical. One in 285 children in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer by the time they are 20 years old. Childhood cancer research and treatments are vastly and consistently underfunded.  Keris, was a proud Kindergarten graduate of Newnan Crossing Elementary School. She was a vibrant and faithful child who bravely battled a rare form of pediatric brain cancer called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) from the age of 4 until her transition at the age of 6.  She made a lasting impression on those that knew her. The name Keris means <strong>love</strong> and <strong>charity. </strong> Our driving motivation is to pay it forward with love and charity and bless other hurting families the same way the community blessed Keris. Proceeds from this event fund our Family Emergency Fund, Keris Kares 4 the Arts program, and our Food for Families Program. Your registration helps us KARE for families, kids, and teachers.  </p>

During that month, the teens participate in a variety of team building, social, sightseeing, spiritual and service activities that enable them to create enduring friendships and mutual understanding.  </h3>",https://runsignup.com/Race/DE/Wilmington/UlsterProjectDelaware5K,http://www.fusionracetiming.com,,ulsterprojectdelaware,,"1591 Gilpin Ave","Conaty Park",Wilmington,DE,19806,US,America/New_York,https://d368g9lw5ileu7.cloudfront.net/races/race71540-logo-0.bGBBdL.png,F,"2025-06-03 19:25:31",hNkiyApi...,9

Run! Walk! Bike! Stroll! This Coronado signature event takes place along one of the top 10 beaches in the world and provides much needed funds with Local Military and First Responders being the primary beneficiaries.

<p><b>WHY THE 5K COURSE?</b></p>
<p>If you have participated in past Low Tide Ride &amp; Stride events, you may have noticed military and civilian volunteers lining the beach along the State Park and Navy Base. They were protecting the Least Tern’s nesting grounds. You see, the Least Terns are an endangered species and their numbers continue to dwindle. Even the military must limit their training on the beach during nesting season March – September. According to the Audubon Society, since 1970 we have lost half of all bird populations globally. By keeping the course of the race off of the Amphibious Base, Rotary is protecting critical nesting grounds for the Least Tern and Snowy Plover. We are excited for race course -- less hassle, family friendly, and fun at Sunset Park!  We can’t think of a better way to bike, run, walk and celebrate the beginning of summer than the Low Tide Ride &amp; Stride!. </p>

<p>We&#39;re happy to announce the 63rd annual Roadrunners Summer Series! In keeping with state COVID19 guidelines for road races, things will look a little different than they have in the past. To keep runners and volunteers safe, we will be instituting the follow protocols:</p>
<ol><li>
<h5><span style=""color:#3598db"">There will be no in-person race day registration on paper forms. Online registration will remain open until the start time. Runners should register before arriving at the race site, or on their phones when they get there, then check in with other pre-registered runners.</span></h5>
</li><li>
<h5><span style=""color:#3598db"">Once again, we will utilize ChronoTrack chip timing technology for all races. This will give all runners a net or &#34;chip&#34; time based on when they cross the start in the first five races, and will have the added benefit of almost instant results. If you sign up for text alerts, your finish time and place will be waiting for you on your phone when you get back to your car. You will also receive an email later on race morning with your individual result, with a video clip of your finish. Thanks to Pequot Runners for providing timing bibs and chips!</span></h5>
</li><li>
<h5><span style=""color:#3598db"">To facilitate this, all runners <span style=""color:#e03e2d""><i><b>must</b></i></span> check in before the race and be assigned a race bib, which must be worn on the front of your shirt or shorts during the race. If you have a bib from a previous Series race you should re-use that, but you still need to check in and tell the volunteer your number.</span></h5>
</li></ol>
<h5><span style=""color:#e03e2d""><i>Note that these protocols may change if state guidelines for road races are modified.</i></span></h5>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color:#0000ff"">ONCE AGAIN - PHOTOS! RunSignUp has added the ability for runners to upload photos to this site. So, after you complete your race, post a photo or two of your run - at the start, finish or in between. The more we get, the better! Just click on the Photo tab on the left side of the screen and post away!</span></strong></p>
<h4><span style=""color:#2dc26b""><i><strong>Due to the pricing structure for online registration, which includes a $2.61 processing fee for each transaction, it will be MUCH cheaper to register for the full 10-race Series if you are doing more than six races. We strongly recommend you take advantage of the Series discount. It will also eliminate the need to register for each race separately online. </strong></i><span style=""color:rgb( 224 , 62 , 45 )""><strong>AND IF YOU REGISTER BY JULY 2, YOU&#39;LL GET A SHORT SLEEVE TECH SHIRT!</strong></span></span></h4>",https://runsignup.com/Race/CT/Westport/WestportSummerSeries,http://www.westportroadrunners.org,,profile.php,,"Multiple Locations",,Westport,CT,06880,US,America/New_York,https://d368g9lw5ileu7.cloudfront.net/uploads/generic/genericImage-websiteLogo-97875-1745349512.3681-0.bOb-Ui.png,F,"2025-06-03 19:25:32",EuMWyAqP...,10

<p><strong>REGISTRATION DETAILS</strong><br />Spots are limited, don’t wait to sign up! There will NOT be day of registration for this race. <br />You must register by Friday August 1st to guarantee their shirt size for the 2025 Shore 2 the Pour Race T! After this date, shirts may be available for participants, but we cannot guarantee your size will be available. </p>
<p><strong>DAY BEFORE CHECK-IN</strong><br />Save yourself time and check-in for the race the night before! Come on down to Two Roads on Friday August 22nd and check-in to receive your bib (with chip), race t and most importantly, beer tickets to redeem after the run! Check-in will be located in the Beer Garden (weather permitted) &#64; 1700 Stratford Ave from 4-6:30pm. <br /><br />Participants are welcome to check-in their friends and family members who are also participating, in fact we encourage it! </p>
<p><strong>DAY OF CHECK-IN</strong><br />Can’t check-in the night before, not a problem! Day of race check-in will be at Short Beach (pavilion 1) from 7:30-9:15am.<br />Look for the signs!</p>
<p><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION</strong><br />Your journey runs on the park driveway and town roads the first mile. Entering the Audubon Center, you will run 7/10 mi on a hard packed grass path around the perimeter of the property. Be prepared to enjoy a beautiful view of Long Island Sound, Stratford Harbor, butterflies, birds, and more! After a short run back on the driveway you’ll run onto the “Two Roads Trail” which is again, hard packed grass and some gravel.</p>
<p>The fun begins just after mile two! The course drops down to beach level and from there you’ll run completely on the sand along the water back to the finish. </p>
<p>The finish will be on the sand/hard packed grass area near the pavilion. <br />Each participant&#39;s finish time will be “Chip” recorded as they cross the finish line. <br />As participants finish, they will receive their Two Roads medal and a text message and/or email with their finishing time!</p>

<p>A list of overall finishing times for all competitors will be continually updated and sent to your email on file while the race is in progress.<br />The final race results should be posted by 10am</p>
<p><br />Water Stop: There will be a water stop a little after the halfway point inside the Audubon grounds. We also encourage everyone to run with a water bottle as temps can be very hot during the summer. Please be respectful and use the trash cans located at this water stop! </p>
<p><strong>NEW THIS YEAR<br /></strong>New this year: we&#39;re excited to introduce our first-ever Kid Fun Run! This free beachside dash kicks off at 11:30AM—just after the main race—so parents can cheer on their little runners while enjoying a pint. All kids will receive a participation medal, and please note: children must be supervised by an adult at all times and cannot be left unattended during the main event.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>TIPS AND NOTES </strong> <br />- For your safety, participants should always remain to the LEFT side of the road indicated by cones, signs, or volunteers. <br />- Please follow all instructions of the course marshals and only cross a street when instructed to do so by the course volunteers.<br /> Once crossing the finish line, please keep moving towards the pavilion to allow room for other runners. Remember, standing too close to the finish line can easily trigger your chip and your time may be changed which will alter your results. <br />-Participants are welcome to run with strollers but, please make note that the last leg of the race is on the sand. There are “steps” (mainly rocks) to get from the Audubon Center to the beach. </p>
<p> <strong>POST RACE CELEBRATION</strong><br />Let’s not forget the best part of the race, the post-race celebration! Once you cross the finish line join us back at the pavilion for a post-race celebration! There will be music, health related vendors and of course, delicious beer! Stay tuned for more information on vendors, food truck and musical performances! <br /><br /><strong>Awards!</strong><br />During our post-race celebration, we will have an award ceremony for the following categories<br />1st Place Man by Age Groups <br /> Age Groups: Under 21, 21-35, 36-50, 51&#43;<br />1st Place Woman by Age Groups <br /> Age Groups: Under 21, 21-35, 36-50, 51&#43;<br />Shore Like Your Style Award- Have fun and get dressed up for the big race!<br />The Road Less Traveled Award- The person who traveled the farthest to attend the race </p>
<p><strong>What is Audubon Connecticut? </strong><br />Audubon Connecticut supports programs that connect people to nature across the state. Through land stewardship, science, education and advocacy, Audubon Connecticut preserves habitat and protects bird species and other wildlife that are of state, national and global concern.  Stratford Point, which is managed by Audubon Connecticut, is one of the best birding destinations in the state and provides 40 acres of habitat that is enjoyed by people, and wildlife. <a href=""https://ct.audubon.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Visit their website here.</a></p>
<p>&#34;With past support from Two Roads, Audubon Connecticut has planted hundreds of trees, shrubs, and perennials that benefit wildlife and worked to control invasive plant species at Stratford Point. More recently, Audubon and partners have led the restoration efforts at the Great Meadows Marsh, a unit of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. As part of the project, we worked with the Town of Stratford to employ 12 local high school students as Salt Marsh Stewards.  The stewards, many volunteers, and partners planted over 150,000 native plants in the restored marsh. Funding from the 2025 Shore 2 Pour will go towards implementing the Salt Marsh Stewards program again in 2026, giving additional students an opportunity to explore careers in conservation and make a difference in their own community.” (Corrie Folsom-O&#39;Keefe, Stratford Point Audubon Representative)</p>

<p><b>About Leah...</b></p>
<p>On October 8, 2013, just a month after starting kindergarten at Matthew Patterson Elementary School in Putnam County, Leah was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Suddenly her world changed to countless trips to Maria Fareri Children’s Hospital; numerous blood transfusions; and a life of seclusion, away from germs and any viruses that could be very harmful. Leah couldn’t return to school and wasn’t able to see her friends for most of the year.</p>
<p>Because of the funds raised by LLS and because of people like you who support events like this Leah and others have benefited from the services LLS offers. With the support of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Leah has gotten through treatments and realized a life after her fight with blood cancer. Her family also got the support they needed throughout, that is why we continue to raise money, to help future families like Leah&#39;s. Having cancer certainly isn&#39;t fair especially for a child and as a parent I can&#39;t imagine what it would be like to tell your child that they have cancer. This is why I honor Leah and help work towards finding the cures.</p>
<p>The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has a commitment to people like Leah struggling and fighting to beat cancer. Blood cancer does not discriminate by age, as you can see. It affects the lives of many people and families and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society exists to not only help those diagnosed with blood cancer through experimental treatments, they provide support to the families as well. This 5k run is in honor of Leah and all its proceeds will go directly to LLS to provide services to make the fight easier for survivors like Leah.</p>

<p>Similar to the last few years, this years event will be split over two days with the <span style=""color:#236fa1""><b>1k Kids Fun Run and 5k on Saturday, September 27th on Robinson Lane in Wappingers Falls, NY</b></span> and the <span style=""color:#2dc26b""><b>10k and Half-Marathon on Sunday, September 28th on the William R. Steinhaus Dutchess Rail Trail / Walkway Over the Hudson in Poughkeepsie, NY</b></span>.</p>
<p>All courses are flat and scenic, great for seasoned runners and first timers alike.  The races will showcase the beauty of the Hudson Valley, including beautiful farm land and views of the Hudson River.  Each race is professionally timed and takes place on a USATF certified course, making the Dutchess County Classic a &#34;must-race&#34; for anyone looking to set their next PR. There are t-shirts for pre-registered (on or before August 31st) runners and finisher medals for the 5k, 10k, half marathon and a special finisher medal for anyone who finishes a race on both days.  In order to receive the special finisher medal for competing on both days you must register for a &#34;COMBO&#34; event.  COMBO prices reflect a $5 discount.</p>
<p><b><span style=""color:#ba372a"">There will be price increases for all races after the first 444 registrants then on July 1 and September 22, so register early to save!</span></b></p>
<h2><b>Start Location &amp; Times</b></h2>
<h5><b>Saturday, September 27th</b></h5>
<p>The kids 1k race will be held on Saturday, September 27th, starting at 8:30 am from Robinson Lane Park (95 Robinson Lane, Wappingers Falls, NY 12590). Kids who are pre-registered always run for free. This event is for kids ages 12 and under.</p>
<p>The 5k race will be held on Saturday, September 27th, starting at 9:00 am from Robinson Lane Park (95 Robinson Lane, Wappingers Falls, NY 12590).  We have adjusted the course to start/finish at the pavilion to reduce traffic congestion at the gate.  This is a flat, out and back &#34;T - Shape&#34; course and is USATF certified.  For those who raced last year, it is a very similar course.  An updated certified map has been posted.</p>
<h5><b>Sunday, September 28th</b></h5>
<p>The half marathon and 10k will both start and end at Dutchess Community College (53 Pendell Road, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601).  Both races will start at 7:30 am. There is a wheel chair option for the half marathon only.</p>
<p>Due to the large volume of runners expected, area road closures and the likelihood for congestion during parking, it is recommended that you arrive at the race at least an hour and a half before race start time even if you already have your bib.</p>
<p>Both the half &amp; 10k will enter the Hudson Valley Rail Trail via the Morgan Lake Trailhead and will include an out &amp; back over the Walkway Over the Hudson.  The 10k runners will head to the finish when they get back near the Morgan Lake Trailhead while the half marathon will continue straight at Morgan Lake and do an out and back from there to the end of the overpass on Manchester Rd and then finish along Creek Road to DCC.  Both courses are USATF certified.</p>
<h2><b>Giveaways &amp; Prizes</b></h2>
<p>There will be giveaway shirts (image to be released once available) for all kids, 5K, 10k and half marathon participants who register before Sunday, August 18th, 11:59 pm. <b>There is no guarantee that you will receive a shirt if you register after August 31st.</b></p>
<p>Prizes will be given for the top 3 overall finishers in each race as well as awards for the top 3 in each age group (10 year age groups).</p>
<p>We will have <b>CASH prizes</b> for our <b>top 3 overall</b> male and female and <strong>1st place masters (50&#43;)</strong> male and female athletes in the <span style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong>5k &amp; HALF-MARATHON ONLY</strong></span>.</p>

Set against the stunning backdrop of Long Island Sound, this race isn’t just about the views—it’s about making a real difference for those who have served our country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every step you take helps U.S. Veterans experiencing homelessness. All proceeds and donations from the event directly benefit Homes for the Brave, a nonprofit in Bridgeport dedicated to providing housing, programs, and services to Veterans in need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether running, walking, or cheering from the sidelines, your participation shows your support for the brave Men and Women who have sacrificed so much. We invite you to be part of this impactful day and honor our Veterans in any way you can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Homes for the Brave?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Homes for the Brave (HFTB), is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit headquartered in Bridgeport, CT. The mission of Homes for the Brave is, with an emphasis on Veterans, to provide the housing and services necessary for individuals experiencing homelessness to return to productive and meaningful lives.

Since its creation in 1998, HFTB has served over 1,700 individuals, while engaging with hundreds of volunteers and local organizations to craft an ever-expanding network of support. They strive to be a beacon of hope and inspiration for the community by providing innovative, comprehensive, and compassionate programs that demonstrate their dedication to our Veterans.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>History of the event</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Priscilla Sanchez Garcia created this annual event to honor the memory of her father, Samuel Sanchez, and his altruistic nature. As a celebration of his life and in efforts to continue his mission of supporting Veterans, we continue to run and walk for a cause. Samuel Sanchez, a Marine Corp Veteran and Purple Heart Recipient, passed away on Father’s Day 2022. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story of Priscilla’s father has not only inspired her but also touched the hearts of many. Her dedication to memorializing her father’s legacy and commitment to charity lives on. This year, she decided to pass the torch and entrust this event to Homes for the Brave, an organization that has supported the 5k since its beginning and is instilled with the same values as her father. Join us in honoring his memory and supporting Veterans by participating in the Annual Honor Our Veterans 5k. </p>",https://runsignup.com/Race/CT/Westport/HonorOurVeterans5k,,,,,"Sherwood Island Connector",,Westport,CT,06880,US,America/New_York,https://d368g9lw5ileu7.cloudfront.net/uploads/generic/genericImage-websiteLogo-143897-1727360522.8805-0.bM9w4k.jpg,F,"2025-06-03 19:25:28",yHvMFx1y...,6

<p>July 4th is celebrated in a number of different ways, with parades, barbecues, sparklers and fireworks, <strong>BUT</strong> there has been no better way since 2008 to get your July 4th morning off to a great start, than doing Boulder’s traditional Avery Brewing Company 4K on the 4th.</p>

<p>The <strong>NEW 8:00AM </strong>start time comes from participant feedback we have received over the last 2 years.</p>
<ul><li><strong>HEAT</strong> - It can be surprisingly warm at 9:00AM, and starting the race 1 hour earlier would allow participants to run/ walk in slightly cooler conditions.</li><li><strong>PARTY</strong> - Starting the race 1 hour earlier, means participants can now party post-race for longer!

Only 3 months later, in January 2022, his 3 year old little brother Bryson was diagnosed with ALL Leukemia. Both Gavin and Bryson were diagnosed with CMMRD, or Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency, which made both boys predisposed to developing aggressive cancers. Treatment began immediately for both boys.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the boys having CMMRD, the cancers in each of the boys grew too rapidly despite their aggressive treatments. Sadly, on February 18, 2023, Gavin passed away at the age of 6. Only 10 months later, on December 19, 2023, Bryson passed away at the age of 5.</p>
<p>The Ahmad Butler Foundation (ABF) assisted the Blounts with everyday financial expenses, as well as funeral costs for both boys.  They continue to support the Blounts with a community of wonderful people who can understand and relate to all the family has been through.</p>
<p>The Ahmad Butler Foundation was established as a charitable nonprofit organization with a mission to support children with cancer and other life threatening diseases, while aiding in the improvement of their quality of life.  The ABF offers programs that focus on filling the educational, social, emotional, and financial gaps experienced by families post-diagnosis.  To date, ABF has served over 10,000 People.  ABF is also the leading group in the Million Family March, a march to demand congress allocate more money to childhood cancer research and support.</p>

<h4><strong>ABOUT ANTHONY GAMMA:</strong></h4>
<p><em>Anthony loved God, his country, his family, his friends, and the outdoors!  Scouting provided abundant opportunities for him to go fishing, hiking, and camping with his friends and family.  He enjoyed learning skills scouting gave him to amplify these opportunities.  As a Cub Scout, Anthony really loved Cub World and the climbing tower.  Fall hayrides, campfires at night, and making s’mores were Anthony’s favorites!  Pinewood Derby was anticipated with enthusiasm and joy every year!  As a Boy Scout, he really enjoyed the lake activities at S-F, woodcarving, hiking, and bonfires.  Camping out in the tent was a big favorite and Anthony loved to retell camping stories.  He loved Beaumont and S-F scout camps as well as numerous other camping excursions.  He enjoyed so many scout activities especially learning the skills and interacting with others to earn merit badges.</em><br /><em>He achieved the rank of Life Scout.  Anthony’s love for God, his country, his family, his friends, and all of nature was fed and magnified through scouting.  His enthusiasm for the outdoors and the friendships he made with fellow scouts as well as his scouting leaders and counselors were very important to him.  He was an avid athlete and especially loved baseball, golf, football, and basketball.  He was always a team player and gave his all in every sport he played.  Anthony loved and appreciated his family, friends, fellow scouts, teammates, leaders, and coaches.  He would want the same for others!</em></p>",https://runsignup.com/Race/MO/SaintPeters/AnthonyGammaMemorialRunBenefitforScouting,,,,,"370 Lakeside Park","1000 Lakeside Park Drive","Saint Peters",MO,63376,US,America/Chicago,https://d368g9lw5ileu7.cloudfront.net/races/race160868-logo-0.bMhv04.png,F,"2025-06-03 19:25:24",KMVON3kq...,1

Ben&#39;s journey is a reminder that given the opportunity, with hard work and focus, you can achieve.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Ben’s childhood was anything but easy. His mother, Carla, was diagnosed with Leukemia and fought hard for many years. As years passed her health rapidly declined. Ben and his siblings were enrolled at Milton Hershey School, in hopes that Carla would win the fight against Leukemia and their family would be reunited. The disease eventually took its toll on her and she lost her battle, a week prior to Ben’s 8th grade graduation. The family struggled with the devastating loss - now four children without a mom. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>While at Milton Hershey, Ben played football and was an asset to the team. Football was his anchor - he found a way to release his anger and frustration, kept his grades, and stayed focused; however, home is where his heart needed to be. He wanted to be back home with his dad. His dad agreed to let him come home, and he enrolled in Newark High School. Not long after his arrival, he had made new friends and was voted junior captain of the football team. It was here he met his future fiancé, Shannon.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Ben was determined to continue his education after high school and played football at Wesley College. He worked really hard and graduated with honors. He was able to see his Dad and siblings and thought all the hard work would pay off. He worked hard every day...really hard. Quotes in this letter are from his application to Widener Law School. Telling his story he said, &#34;Nothing in my life has been handed to me. I worked hard for every accolade. I expect to work hard to earn my law degree and when the academics get tough, I will never give up. When I earn my degree, I will use it to help as many families as possible.”</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Ben graduated from Widener Law School in May of 2021 with honors! He worked part time for Baird Mandalas Brockstedt and Federico LLC while he studied for the bar exam. Again, he rallied with friends and studied like it was a full-time job. His work ethic was an amazing example of grit and determination. He passed the Bar and was hired by Baird, Mandalas, Brockstedt, and Federico LLC full time. He did it... he overcame his circumstances!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Ben was engaged to his high school sweetheart, Shannon, and was to be married on October 7, 2023. They attended Newark High School and Wesley together. They were champions with a pursuit of helping others, She became an RN at Christiana Hospital. His fairytale was coming true.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>On July 29 tragedy struck. Eight weeks before he was to marry the love of his life, Ben was killed in an accident and taken from us. No farewell words were spoken. No time to say goodbye. He was gone before we knew it and now we are left asking why.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Since last July, the Campbell Family and Ben’s friends and extended family have been picking up the pieces of this horrible tragedy. The Ben Campbell Memorial Fund has been established to help others, as Ben would have wanted and what he devoted his career to doing. We would love to see as many people out to celebrate Ben’s life and raise as much money as possible for the Fund. The 5k will start and end at Ben’s Alma Mater, Newark High School. The course will take you through the City of Newark. We welcome all walkers and runners of all abilities. </strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>There will be a post-rate after party at Deer Park Tavern starting at 10:30am. There will be amazing raffles to purchase tickets for and other donation and fundraising opportunities. We would love to see everyone after. </strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>“Teams” are made for Newark High School Alumni, MIlton Hershey School Alumni, Wesley Alumni, Delaware Law Alumni, ChristianaCare, Baird, Mandalas, and Brockstedt &amp; Federico LLC that you can join when you register for the race. All of these organizations were major pillars in Ben’s life, and we would love to see as many people from each of these groups as possible! If you would like to make an additional team, please feel free to do so at sign up. </strong></h3>

<h5><strong>Join The Surfside Hotel and Connoisseur Media as we support our charity partner MAKE-A-WISH® CONNECTICUT!</strong></h5>
<p>When a wish is granted, a child replaces fear with confidence, sadness with joy and anxiety with hope. The majority of wish kids go on to beat their critical illnesses, and research shows that a wish can help children build the physical and emotional strength they need to fight – giving them a better chance of surviving and thriving. There are over 300 Connecticut children waiting for their wishes to be granted who count on donors like you to help make their wish come true.</p>
<p><strong><em>Summer should be a time of joy for children, but wish kids often miss out due to their illness, creating a dark chapter during a time that should be filled with sunshine and memories.</em></strong> </p>
<p>A wish can change everything for these children - giving them the strength and hope they need to persevere in their fight against critical illness. The summertime is <strong>Make-A-Wish® Connecticut&#39;s</strong> busiest wish-granting season, but it can also be a time when we receive the least amount of financial support. With over 300 kids waiting for their wishes to be granted, we need your help!</p>

The Helping Hands Committee was established as a part of the Frankenmuth Rotary Club in 2017 to help struggling and disadvantaged individuals and families in the local area. Your donations have made a huge impact - from replacing water heaters, paying overdue medical bills, helping abused women and children resettle, replace hearing aids for elderly people who are making decisions to eat rather than hear because they cannot afford both and many others. To date we have given more than $70,000 in assistance.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE ABOUT THE TRAIN: </strong>We cannot control the train schedule, though we wish we could! The 5K course is not impacted by the trains. However, the train tracks do run parallel between the start and the finish line. In some years this has caused a delay for spectators who want to watch both the start and the finish of the race. To ensure you don’t miss the finish, we suggest making a plan to cheer for runners from in front of The Station or near the Finish Line along Broadway.</p>

<p>The Race: Come out to Midland City Forest in Midland, MI – same site as the popular Snow Moon Trail Run - as runners embark on a 5k, 10k or 25k race along wide trails (not single track) marked by small LED lights as guides. Runners completing multiple laps will have split times as they pass through the 5k finish arch for each lap until they complete either their 10k or 25k events. A daytime 5K option is also available for those who’d like to see the course in the daylight.<br /> <br />All participants will receive a professionally timed event with Red Moon Finisher Medals and (for those of legal age) a couple of adult Beverages.

The alternative would be to start the longer events at 9pm - which is WAY too late for many folks (a fact also obtained through feedback).<br />Location:  Midland City Forest</p>

<p><strong>FAQ’s</strong></p>
<p>Can I run/walk with a stroller?</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, no. A large portion of the run/walk course is “out and back” along the narrow river trail and strollers of any sort would impede runners and walkers in both directions.</em></p>
<p>What does “USATF Sanctioning” mean?</p>
<p><em>It means that organizers have followed a process with USA Track &amp; Field that requires creation of a safety plan and purchase of outstanding insurance covering participants, volunteers, sponsors, partners and organizers of the event.  It also means that your race results will be official for scoring purposes (assuming you track that sort of thing).</em></p>
<p><strong>Refund and Transfer Policy</strong></p>
<p>We completely understand that plans change and athletes will sometimes be unable to compete in an event they&#39;ve signed up for.  We also understand that registering for one of our events is a financial investment in that race. We accept your registration funds with the full intention of putting on the promised event with the listed amenities and we use your registration funds to pay for the necessary items and services needed to host the event. With that in mind, refunds will not be provided for this event unless the event is cancelled for reasons within our control.  The following are examples (but not limited to) of reasons an event might be canceled that are NOT within our control: Dangerous weather; natural disasters; pandemics; acts of terrorism; local emergencies; government mandates; and any situation creating a threat to safety of participants, volunteers, staff or bystanders.</p>
<p>Should an athlete have an injury or other medical issue keeping them from competing in an event they&#39;ve registered for, we would be happy to transfer their registration to a similar Dig Deep-owned event up to and including the same event the following season.  A doctor&#39;s slip may be required as proof of injury or ailment.  Failure to provide proof if requested will result in non-transfer of the event.</p>
<p>Transferring registrations to other runners/athletes is NOT allowed.</p>",https://runsignup.com/Race/MI/Saginaw/TeamOneWineRun5K,https://digdeepraces.com/teamonewinerun,,5kwinerunsaginaw,,"Jolt Credit Union Event Park","300 Johnson St",Saginaw,MI,48607,US,America/Detroit,https://d368g9lw5ileu7.cloudfront.net/uploads/generic/genericImage-websiteLogo-255638-1748973743.1497-0.bOpZIV.png,F,"2025-06-03 19:25:35",OiX84NDS...,12
