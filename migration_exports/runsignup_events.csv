There are some small seasonal streams and one wooden bridge.  There are no large stream crossings.  The two largest hills are at the one mile (long, not so steep) and the three mile (short and steep!) marks.  Depending on the weather for prior days and weeks and the season of the year, some of the course may be wet and muddy but most of the course is well drained.

All competitors in the individual competition will complete all three legs of the duathlon, which are a cross country/trail race, a trail bike race, and a shorter trail race. The first leg distance will be approximately 5K (3.1 miles) on the Bellevue State Park cross country trail. The second leg distance will consist of three ~3.2K loops (~2.2 miles each) (total approximately ~6.7 miles). The third leg will be a shorter (approximately 0.8 mile) leg along the oval track/trail. The course map is available on our website and may be adjusted slightly in the spring to ensure a smooth race and transition between each of the legs and finish.

For scoring purposes, the individual race will be divided into men's and women's competitions and subdivided into age groups.

994666,40382,"First State Duathlon - 2 person relay team","Friends can compete together as a relay team/squad in the relay team division of the duathlon. Larger organizations or groups of friends can enter multiple relay teams/squads and individuals in the duathlon. 

Like the individual duathlon race, the relay teams will complete all three legs of the duathlon. The three legs are a cross country/trail race, a trail bike race, and a shorter trail race. The first leg distance will be approximately 5K (3.1 miles) on the Bellevue State Park cross country trail. The second leg distance will consist of three ~3.2K loops (~2.2 miles each) (total approximately ~6.7 miles). The third leg will be a shorter (approximately 1 mile) leg along the oval track/trail. The course map is available on our website and may be adjusted slightly in the spring to ensure a smooth race and transition between each of the legs and finish.

For scoring purposes, those 2-person relay teams/squads will be scored against the other 2-person relay teams/squads, and the competition will be subdivided into men's, women's, and co-ed divisions based on the number of team registrations.

Two person relay teams/squads are $90 ($45/person). This price includes the admission cost for one car to park at the park that morning. The captain of the 2-person team will have to sign up for both teammates at once. One person will complete both running legs and the other person will complete the bike leg. First team to the finish wins.","7/20/2025 08:00","7/20/2025 12:00",,"10/8/2024 08:00",duathlon,"11 Miles",F,T,T,"Giveaways/swag will be finalized and announced on our website","2025-06-03 19:25:31",hNkiyApi...,9
